# DICOM Builder

The library came out after a research I made on the DICOM standard and `libdicom` library and could be useful for programmatically build DICOM files.

Check the examples directory for more details at ![https://github.com/voidz0r/dicombuilder/examples](https://github.com/voidz0r/dicombuilder/examples)

More details about the DICOM standard at ![DCOM Standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part05.html#table_6.2-1)

Note: the example uses pwn tools to build cyclic patterns. You can install via `pip install pwntools`.

This package can be installed via pip as well by cloning the repo and:

`pip install -e .`

Or `pip install dicombuilder` when the application is on PyPi
